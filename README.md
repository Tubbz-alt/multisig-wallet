## 1. What is the MultiSig Wallet

The purpose of multisig wallets is to increase security by requiring multiple parties to agree on transactions before execution.

## 2. How does it work?

Transactions within the multisig wallet is only executed only when confirmed by a predefined number of owners.

## 3. Why a MultiSig Wallet?

Zulu Republic believes that security is paramount in its application, so it is uses a modified yet secure version of [Gnosis multisig wallet](https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet) for its purposes.

### Smart Contracts

-   MultiSigWallet.sol

Based on the Gnosis wallet, this multisig contract allows the storing of ether as well as tokens in a secure manner. It permits the addition/removal od owners that will manage the contract as well as the number of required confirmation for funds to leave the contract.

-   MultiSigWalletFactory.sol

Used for deployment of multisig contracts, this contract keeps track of the MultiSig created within Zulu applications.
